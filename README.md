First, run this command on terminal:
```
pip install twitter
```

Then, add all your api key stuff to tokens_example.txt and rename it to tokens.txt. Make sure you leave a space after the equals sign or else the code will break because I was lazy.
```
access_token = ####
access_secret = ####
api_key = ####
api_secret = ####
```
Then, run the code!
```
python scraper.py
```
